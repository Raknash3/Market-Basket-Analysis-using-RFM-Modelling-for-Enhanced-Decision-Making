# Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive retail analytics project focused on understanding customer behavior, decoding market basket insights, and forecasting future sales trends. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including Market Basket Analysis, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis, K-means clustering, and ARIMA modeling, the project provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the dynamic retail landscape.

# Key Features:
- Market Basket Analysis: Uncover customer purchasing patterns and item associations through advanced algorithms like FP-growth and Apriori.

- RFM Analysis: Explore customer behavior based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics. Identify customer segments such as Loyal Customers, Hibernating Customers, and Potential Loyalists.

- K-means Clustering: Enhance customer segmentation by partitioning customers into distinct groups, ensuring targeted marketing efforts.

- Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA: Predict future sales trends by analyzing historical data. The ARIMA model provides insights into temporal aspects of sales, allowing for accurate predictions.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze sales trends, price sensitivity, and product-specific patterns for actionable insights.
